# Predicting Big Sales with Random Forest Regressor

## Introduction

This project aims to predict big sales using the Random Forest Regressor model. By leveraging historical sales data and features such as store size, location, and promotional activities, we aim to provide accurate sales forecasts.

## Objective

### First: Data Exploration and Cleaning

We will explore and clean the data. Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features are crucial steps to ensure data quality and prepare it for model training.

### Second: Data Visualization

We will create various visualizations to gain deeper insights into the data. These visualizations will help us understand feature importance and identify any additional variables that might improve our predictions.

### Finally: Machine Learning Prediction

We will employ the Random Forest Regressor to predict sales. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Visualizations of feature importances and sales predictions will help us understand the model's behavior and accuracy.
