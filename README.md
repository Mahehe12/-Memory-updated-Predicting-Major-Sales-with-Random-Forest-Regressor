# -Memory-updated-Predicting-Major-Sales-with-Random-Forest-Regressor
This project uses the Random Forest Regressor to predict big sales. By analyzing store size, location, promotions, and historical sales data, we help businesses make better decisions. We preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate it using MAE and RMSE. Visualizations show key features and prediction accuracy.
